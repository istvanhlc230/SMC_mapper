Status: FIXED_CLEAR_TEXT_EVENT_SEPARATOR_CI_PENDING_LIVE_SMOKE

## Change
The Windows live smoke showed that ForexFactory acquisition succeeds, but most events persisted
with `impact=UNKNOWN`. After the first normalization fix, one real HIGH event was correctly
classified, proving the normalizer was active.

Root cause of the remaining issue: the actual structured ForexFactory event objects expose
`impactTitle` (for example `High Impact Expected` / `Low Impact Expected`) and compact
`impactClass` icon forms such as `icon--ff-impact-yel`. The implementation previously looked
for `impactName` first and did not recognize these actual fields/forms.

Calendar implementation version: 2.2.9
Persistent schema: 2

The fix now recognizes the rendered abbreviated provider icon classes `icon--ff-impact-ora`,
`icon--ff-impact-yel`, `icon--ff-impact-grn`, and `icon--ff-impact-gry`, in addition to the existing
red/high and long-form classes. Severity remains explicit only.

## Validation
Regression tests cover:
- impactTitle: High, Med, Low, Non-Economic;
- impactName compatibility forms;
- impactClass color/icon forms, including `icon--ff-impact-yel`;
- existing rendered HTML impact parsing.

A fresh CI result and a clean Windows live smoke remain required. The live smoke must explicitly
remove the existing COMPLETE coverage before reacquiring the same interval, because Calendar
intentionally does not refetch already complete coverage.

Acceptance target: real ForexFactory events persist explicit HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/HOLIDAY values instead
of UNKNOWN whenever the provider supplies explicit impact metadata.


## Latest presentation fix

The `--cleartext` presentation previously serialized the complete normalized `details` dictionary on one line. This was machine-readable JSON embedded inside a human-readable mode and was therefore not an appropriate cleartext representation.

Calendar implementation version: 2.2.10
Persistent schema: 2

The CLI now renders `Details` as deterministic individual fields, keeps the canonical details object unchanged, and displays null values as `N/A`. Default JSON output is unchanged.

## Validation target

CI must pass the new cleartext regression assertion. A fresh Windows live smoke should confirm the resulting presentation against the real ForexFactory events.


## Latest cleartext presentation refinement

The closing dashed separator after each cleartext event was removed because the next event header already provides the event boundary. Consecutive events are separated by one blank line only. The canonical event data and machine-readable JSON output are unchanged.

Regression coverage asserts that the closing separator is absent and that adjacent cleartext event blocks use the blank-line separator.
